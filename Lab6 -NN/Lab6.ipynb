The `.mat` format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment. Fortunately, python provides mechanisms to load MATLAB native format using the `loadmat` function within the `scipy.io` module. This function returns a python dictionary with keys containing the variable names within the `.mat` file. \n",

Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix `X`. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix `X` where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",
